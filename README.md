# Mini-prject-algorithmic-motion-planning
Code of my mini-project
Hey, started at 6:20 tuesday
make a note of important lines for psuedo code
1 day for documentation
The code for this mini-project is written in C++
Upon running these text files, the progess of the output of the planner will be displayed in the command prompt
Sometimes, the tree growth may reduce drastically during runtime. In this case, it is recommended to run the program again
The output path and the tree will be converted to .csv files at the end of the main() function
The .csv files have to be plotted in MATLAB. (Please make sure that the directory of MATLAB is set to the folder where the .csv files are stored)
